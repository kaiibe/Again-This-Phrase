hey guys how's it going today i want totake a look at something that you'reprobably going to see a lot in pythonand that is this line right here ifdouble underscore name is equal todouble underscore main so what is thisdoing and why do people use it welllet's go ahead and comment this code outand just right off the bat let's printout this double underscore name variableso if i save this code and run it youcan see that i just ran this firstmodule dot pi and when i got whenever iprinted out the double underscore namewas double underscore main and actuallyto make this more clear i'm going to goahead and put in that this is the firstmodules name variable and let me do aformat and pass in that name variablenow whenever i save that and run it nowyou can see down here first modules nameand then we have double underscore mainso what exactly is going on here wellwhenever python runs a file at firstgoes through before it even runs anycode it sets a few special variables andname is one of those special variablesand when python runs a python filedirectly it sets this name variableequal to main and that's what we'redoing here we're running this file we'rerunning this code from the file firstmodule pi now we can also import modulesnow whenever we import a module it'sgoing to set this named variable to thename of the file so in this case itsfirst underscore module so let's goahead and see what this looks like soi'm going to go over here to secondmodule dot pi and i'm going to importfirst module and save thatand whenever you import a file it runsthat code and so it's going to come inhere and it's going to print out thisline and whenever we ran this line fromfirst module dot pi we got first modulesname is double underscore main wheneverwe run second module that pi and importthat module now you can see that it saysfirst modules name is first module andthe reason that's doing that is becausethis file is no longer being rundirectly by python it's being importedand we can actually take a look atsecond module dot pi's let me copy thisfrom first module and let me paste thisinto second module dot pi change this tosecond so now i have second modules nameand let me run this so now you can seethat it's importing first module andfirst modules name from this file isfirst module because it being importedsecond modules name is main becausepython is running this file directly andnow this brings us back to the code thatwe first started with so now i canuncomment out this code and now we cansee why something like this would beuseful because we can check if doubleunderscore name is equal to main whichpretty much is saying is this file beingrun directly by python or is it beingimported so let me bring this down andcut this out and i'm going to paste thisinto this main method here save that sonow if i run this file first module dotpi i'm running it directly so i just ranit and you can see that it went throughand it said if double underscore name isequal to main run this main method cameinto the main method and print it outfirst modules name is main now if i goback here to second module dot pi and irun this code you can see the importedfirst module butonly printed out second modules name isdouble underscore main now the reasonthat it didn't print first modules nameis because now we have this check inplace if double underscore name is equalto main nowthis whenever it rent came through andran this code its saw that doubleunderscore name was equal to firstmodule and not main so then it nevermade it to this main method and it neverprinted out this statement here and justto illustrate this further i can go inthe first module here i can type in andan else condition and then let me takeout i'm just going to take out this mainmethod and from here i'm going to do aprint statement that says run directlyand then in the else i'm gonna say runfrom import save that and whenever i runthis file first module dot pi whenever irun it directly you can see that thisfile was the main method got rundirectly i come over here now to thesecond module dot pi and i import firstmodule and run this you can see it saysrun from import because it hit this elsestatement and you can see that it'sbeing imported so hopefully that clearsup any confusion that you may have hadabout the statement here if name isequal to main the reason this is used isbecause you know sometimes there is codethat you only want to run wheneveryou're running this as the main file andsometimes there's code that you onlywant to run whenever it's being importedand one more thing here if we bring backthis main method and then i'm gonna putin a print statement here i'm just goingto put first modulesmain method and save that and then runthat within here and then also up abovethis i'm going to put in a few printstatements that is just a c print thiswill be run this will always be run sosave that and then whenever i run thisyou can see this will always be runfirst modules main method one reasonthat you might want to put all of yourcode inside of method like this insteadof just putting all the code that youwant to run down here in thisconditional if you make this method andthen within this conditional where itsays if double underscore name is equalto main and then run this what thatallows us to do is if we come over hereto second module dot pi and let me rerunthis now you can see that it importedfirst module and it says this willalways be run and that's because it isoutside of that main method so it'sgoing to get run regardless even if it'simportant and then second modules nameis main now with that main method if wewanted to run that from second moduledot pi then we can actually come in hereand call that directly so i can savethat and now if i rerun this file nowyou can see that it's importing firstmodule and it's not meeting thiscondition so it doesn't run the mainmethod on the import but then if we wantto run that anyway then we can say firstmodule dot main then it comes in hereprints that out and then continues onwith the rest of the code in secondmodule dot pi so i really hope thisvideo was useful and explained this wellenough if
